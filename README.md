 Effective Time Management for JEE Main 2025 Preparation

Time management is one of the most critical aspects of succeeding in JEE Main. With a vast syllabus and intense competition, aspirants must utilise every moment effectively.

Steps for Effective Time Management

Create a Study Schedule: Divide your day into dedicated slots for each subject and stick to it.

Prioritise Topics: Focus on high-weightage topics first to maximise your scoring potential.

Utilise Short Breaks: Take 5-10 minute breaks after every hour of study to maintain focus.

Set Weekly Goals: Regularly monitor your progress by setting achievable weekly targets.

Avoid Multitasking: Concentrate on one subject or topic at a time for better understanding.

Balancing Practice and Theory
While theoretical understanding is important, problem-solving practice is equally critical. Dedicate at least 40% of your study time to solving questions.
